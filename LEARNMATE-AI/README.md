# LearnMate AI

## Overview
LearnMate AI is an AI-powered educational assistant designed to help students learn effectively through interactive flashcards, quizzes, and a conversational study buddy. It leverages large language models to generate study materials from raw notes and provide real-time answers to academic questions.

## UI Redesign: Classic Techy Vibe with Extraordinary Elements
This version of LearnMate AI features a completely redesigned user interface, focusing on an elegant, classic techy aesthetic. Key UI enhancements include:

*   **Revamped Color Palette:** Utilizes a dark, futuristic background with vibrant neon blue, purple, and green accents to create a high-tech feel.
*   **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Features a subtle animated grid pattern and a soft scanline overlay for an immersive, data-flow ambiance.
*   **Enhanced Component Styling:**
    *   **Cards/Containers:** Improved "glassmorphism" effect with stronger blur, pulsating neon borders, and a subtle 3D tilt on hover.
    *   **Inputs & Textareas:** Designed for a "holographic" data entry feel with glowing borders on focus.
    *   **Buttons:** Interactive gradient buttons with light streak animations on hover and a subtle glitch-like effect on click, providing a tactile, futuristic experience.
*   **Extraordinary Elements:** Key interactive areas incorporate a custom pulsing glow effect, adding a layer of sophisticated visual engagement.
*   **Responsive and Intuitive Design:** Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices.
