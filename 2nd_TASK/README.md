💻 Code Comment & Explainer

A simple Next.js app that uses a local LLaMA model (via Ollama) to:

Explain code step by step in plain English

Support file uploads (.js, .py, .java, etc.)

Provide clean UI with Monaco editor, copy & download options

📖 About the Project

This project was built as part of my internship.
It is a developer tool that helps understand unfamiliar code quickly, saves time on documentation, and improves productivity — similar to an IDE assistant, but it runs completely offline using local AI.
